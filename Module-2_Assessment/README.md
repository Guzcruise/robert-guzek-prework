help the player get an idea of which iconic characters
they can guess.

Once the player loads into the game, they will be greeted by
some fun messages and emojis, all video game related. when the
player presses any key to begin the game, audio files will begin playing at the START, VICTORY, and DEFEAT screens to make the game a little more enjoyable and arcade-like.
------------------------------------------------------------
The game will also have an 8 bit moving background, this was also intended to help the player feel like they are playing in an arcade.

Once they player guesses the correct word, the appropriate image of the character will be displayed. If the player gets the word wrong then the image will not change.

Everytime the player gets a new word, they will be given ten attempts before defeat, and in the same box of stats, titled 'STATSHEET', the overall resulted will be shown, such as victories and defeats.
