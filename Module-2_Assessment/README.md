Module 2 Assessment - Game - Robert Guzek
------------------------------------------------------------
The theme for the game is iconic video game characters.
The player will play the game using hints, the hints will
help the player get an idea of which iconic characters
they can guess. The guesses will also be displayed to let the user know which letters were already guessed.
------------------------------------------------------------
Once the player loads into the game, they will be greeted by
some fun messages and emojis, all video game related. when the
player presses any key to begin the game, audio files will begin playing at the START, VICTORY, and DEFEAT screens to make the game a little more enjoyable and arcade-like.
------------------------------------------------------------
The game will also have an 8 bit moving background, this was also intended to help the player feel like they are playing in an arcade.
------------------------------------------------------------
Once they player guesses the correct word, the appropriate image of the character will be displayed. If the player gets the word wrong then the image will not change.
------------------------------------------------------------
Regardless of victory or defeat, the player will be prompted to press a key to reset the game so the player can play again, and will be once again greeted by a voice telling them to 'start'.
------------------------------------------------------------
Everytime the player gets a new word, they will be given ten attempts before defeat, and in the same box of stats, titled 'STATSHEET', the overall results will be shown, such as victories and defeats.
------------------------------------------------------------
Now that you know how the game looks and runs... its time to TEST YOUR MIGHT!
