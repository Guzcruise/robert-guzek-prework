                    a guy who likes to fun, I occasionally
                    like to ride on my electric skateboard
                    and swim! I also really love video games, I 
                    even started the first ever video game 
                    development club at Marquette University!
                    I am also very into comic books with my favorite
                    hero being Batman. Lastly I am really into custom
                    PCs, I built mine and I use it everyday!

                    before 2020 is over is to speak a third
                    language, I already know English and Polish
                    and would like to know Japanese!

                I also believe in eating healthy and staying
                fit, going to the gym is a good way to relieve 
                myself of stress. I also enjoy shopping locally 
                as this is the best way of getting food from 
                ethical sources.
